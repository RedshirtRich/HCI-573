^0^$^0^$^Sustainable Journey^$^1^$^Week 1: Dumping on Garbage^$^Your Guide: The Earthworm^$^Hi I am Jim, your guide for the first part of your journey, \"Dumping on the Garbage.\" Why should you listen to me?, you may ask. The reason is that one of the nature\'s best recyclers! I eat up bites of garbage and turn them into fresh soil. I would like to share with you what I know about living an Earth-friendly lifestyle. Humans throw away tons of garbage everyday. The sad part is that there is no such place as \"away.\" If you think about it, your garbage has not gone \"away\", it has only be taken to someplace out or your sight. People need to change their throw away habits. The Earth\'s recycle creatures, like me, cannot keep up with all the garbage, and that\'s not good. Each person needs to learn to reduce the amount of garbage he or she personally creates. This is part of the journey will help you do that.^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^http://www.youtube.com/embed/PRli1rRMoSQ^$^earthworm.jpg^$^null^$^null^$^null^
^1^$^3^$^Sustainable Journey^$^1^$^Week 1: Dumping on Garbage^$^No Garbage Lunches^$^If your throwaway habits are like those of most kids, the garbage you send to a land fill every year takes up a space big enough to park a small car in! Much of this comes from your school lunch, picnic trash, or snacks at a friend\'s home. Plastic wrappers you throw \"away\" may stay in a landfill for 70 years. The paper bag you use could have been replaced by a reusable one made of cotton or cloth. This Earth Action will help you to reduce the amount of garbage you send to the landfill.^$^Package your food and drink in materials that are designed for more than one use (airtight plastic containers with lids for sandwiches, salads, and snacks, and a thermos for your drink)^$^Use your backpack, a reusable bag or cloth bag to carry your lunch^$^null^$^null^$^Cloth bag or backpack, plastic containers, and a thermos^$^About 15 minutes to search through cupboards^$^greenclock.jpg^$^null^$^null^$^backpack.jpg^$^container.jpg^$^thermo.jpg^

I enjoy a special relationship with the Sun, for I fly so high that I come closer to it than any other creature on Earth. The Sun does not get a lot of visitors, and so we have become close friends. Over a long, long period of time, the dinosaurs, other animals that died were slowly buried in the Earth, but the Sun\'s energy was stored in them! Those animals turned into fossil fuels(coal, oil and gas). People want the fossil fuels because the Sun\'s energy that was stored in the creatures that lived millions of years ago is still there! These fossil fuels are used in your home so that you can listen to your MP3. They are also burned in your cars, buses so that you can go to school quickly. However, there are two problems that concern scientists about fossil fuels. First, since the fuel comes from ancient plants and animals, when will the Supply run out? It takes the Earth millions of years to make fossils. At the rate humans are using them up, the energy source can\'t last much longer. The second problem is that when these fossil fuels are burned, they give off gases. You have probably seen or smelled the gases behind cars and buses, or seen them drifting from chimneys on cold mornings. The gases are bad for the air you and I breathe. How you use energy affects not only your family and you, but also every other living thing on Earth. As your guide, I will teach you how to use energy with greater care and wisdom.^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^null^$^http://www.youtube.com/embed/RuN-tFvgRc0^$^eagle.jpg^$^null^$^null^$^null^

^36^$^3^$^Sustainable Journey^$^4^$^Week 4: Good Buys are Forever^$^Toxic Sleuth^$^If you look under the sink, in the kitchen closet and in the workroom, shed, or garage, you will probably see a large number of products used to spruce up around the home. The major ones are: 1) cleaning detergents for appliances, floors, clothes, windows, and furniture 2) paints, varnishes, and stains for inside and outside your home and 3) bug repellents, car and yard products. There products will help get the job done, however, many of them contain ingredients that can be harmful to the Earth and, in some cases, you, too. You and your family need to use these products with care. When products that contain toxics are sprayed, they may harm the air and you. Toxic containing products that are spread on the ground can harm the soil, and the toxics can seep into underground streams and find their way into your drinking water. By taking this Earth Action, you can identify these products that can cause harm and alert your parents to the fact that many of these products have nontoxic alternatives.^$^There are three parts to this Earth Action:(1) make a list of products in your home that might be toxic; (2) find out where to get nontoxic products that will do the same things; and (3) find out how to get rid of all the toxic stuff safely. ^$^With a parent, do a detective search in all the places in your home where these products may be found. If you don\'t see advertising on the label that describes the ingredients as Earth-friendly, there\'s a chance the product contains toxics. WARNING: Do not open any containers. Wash your hands when you are finished. ^$^Make a lost of the possibly toxic products you find (bleach, bug sprays, oven cleaner, paints etc.). Show your parent(s) your list when you are done. ^$^Call your local hardware store, supermarket, or health food store to see whether they have Earth-friendly products with which you could replace these toxic products. if they do, alert your parent(s) as to where they can find these products. If your local stores do not stock Earth-friendly products, ask them to carry them.

^38^$^3^$^Sustainable Journey^$^4^$^Week 4: Good Buys are Forever^$^Chew on This for A While^$^The single most important action you can take for the Earth is to eat less meat. \"Why?\" you ask. The water, energy, and land necessary to produce meat uses more of the Earth\'s resources than almost anything else that you will ever consume and is one of the most significant ways we each contribute to global warming! While beef, chicken, and pork can be raised in ways that carefully use the Earth\'s resources, chances are the meat in your supermarket demander a huge amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, energy, and water. The beef in your hamburger may well have come from cattle that grazed where the rainforest was cut down so that beef could be raised. This Earth Action will offer you alternative ideas for meals that use less of the Earth\'s resources.^$^The Earth Action this week is to eat two fewer meat meals than usual and to commit to keep looking for ways to eat less meat after this week is over. Here is how to do this: ^$^Look through cookbooks for tasty nonmeat recipes, then tell your parent(s). ^$^Ask your parent(s) to make nonmeat meals each week.

That happens to a lot of adults, not just kids. People sometimes buy things just to make themselves feel good or just to have something new and different. Also, TV makes thing look pretty appealing. It makes you want the stuff advertised. This Earth Action will give you a healthy, free, and fun alternative to spur-of-the-moment shopping.^$^Instead of buying something to make you feel good, take a hike in nature with a friend, go for a bike ride, or play a game.^$^ Choose a fun place, Ask your parent(s) to help you make sure your route is safe.^$^null^$^null^$^A fun, safe route; a no garbage lunch; comfortable shoes and clothing; and transportation^$^An afternoon or a few hours on the weekend^$^pinkclock,jpg^$^null^$^null^$^map.jpg^$^lunch.jpg^$^transportation.jpg^

Everything people use in made from resources that come from the Earth. Buying is fine, but how we choose what to buy is important. When you look at a product, do you think of the two costs it has There is both the cost in one and the cost to the Earth. Most shoppers think in dollars and not \"sense\". This Earth Action will help you to buy in a manner that causes the least cost to the Earth.^$^Follow the \"terrific trio\" of guidelines-QPE-when shopping. Q (quality): Choose products with the best quality, because they last longer. P (packaging): Examine the packaging. Did the manufacturer use as little as possible, or is there excess packaging? Is the packaging made from recyclable materials? E (Earth-friendliness): Consider the cost to the Earth. Is the product made from recycled materials? Can it be recycled? Is it locally made? Is it  nontoxic? Is it biodegradable? ^$^Very few things you buy will meet all the terrific trio guidelines. But if you buy with these in mind and find products with one or two, you\'re on the right path. Look for addresses on the labels of the products you normally buy. Write to those companies that need to make changes based on the \"terrific trio\" guidelines. ^$^Ask them to consider more Earth-friendly ways of making or packaging their product so that you can continue to purchase their products. Be specific with your suggestions. Companies really do pay attention. Also, write to companies that have made changes or have made products with the \"terrific trio\" in mind and let them know that  you appreciate what they are doing for the Earth.

There is a solution-organic produce! Organic means that the plant was grown without harmful pesticides. Organically grown food tastes better and is healthier for you and the Earth. It may cost more money to buy, but you can offset that cost with money saved from eating less meat and other resource saving action.

That produce also had to be shipped to the store from a farm. That means fossil fuels were probably burned, creating air pollution and global warming. Much of the produce has to be kept cool, requiring that more energy is use and more fossil fuels are burned. Also, packaging was needed for shipping and was then discarded or recycled.
